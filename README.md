# Landsat-Temperature

This research explores the analysis and visual representation
of Land Surface Temperature (LST) in an urban area of Tamil Nadu
India to handle essential problems from both rapid urbanization and cli-
mate change. Surface temperature variations generate important changes
in local climate patterns which result in urban heat island development.
LST functions as a vital measurement tool to check urban transformation
and test different strategies which attempt to reduce heat impacts. This
research makes efficient use of United States Geological Survey satellite
data as well as Google Earth Engine capabilities to process vast geospa-
tial dataset information. The analysis depth becomes stronger through
the application of machine learning and advanced data processing meth-
ods that run under Google Colab. The presented study displays compre-
hensive visual representations of LST spatial-temporal patterns while
showing how land use and population patterns together with vegetation
cover affect surface temperatures. The researchers advocate for an inter-
active website as a method to display analysis results so policymakers
and urban planners together with the general public can engage more
effectively. This paper uses advanced methods to study urban climate
processes which builds understanding for climate-resistant planning so-
lutions that protect the environment as cities grow in response to climate
change changes.
